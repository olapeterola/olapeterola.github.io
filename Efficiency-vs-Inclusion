Every time a major AI breakthrough is announced, the conversation tends to orbit around capability—what the system can now do faster, cheaper, or better than before. But beneath the excitement sits a quieter, harder question:

If machines can run the economy more efficiently than humans, what happens to human economic participation?

This is the tension between efficiency and economic inclusion. And it may be one of the most difficult governance challenges of this AI era—not because it is technically complex, but because it forces us to confront what kind of society we actually want.

## The Promise of Efficiency

AI systems are extraordinary engines of optimisation. They reduce friction. They compress time. They remove human error, fatigue, and inconsistency. A well-trained model can perform cognitive tasks in seconds that once required teams of analysts. Autonomous systems can operate continuously without wages, rest, or negotiation.

From a narrow economic standpoint, this is close to ideal. Productivity rises. Costs fall. Output expands. Entire industries can be reorganised around automation.

If we define economic success as total output (GDP, profit margins, efficiency ratios), then AI looks like an almost unambiguous win.

But economies are not just production machines. They are social systems.

And that is where the tension begins.

## The “Problems” of Efficiency

Markets are remarkably effective at rewarding productivity. They are much less effective at guaranteeing distribution.

When AI replaces or compresses human labour, the gains do not disperse evenly by default. They tend to flow toward:

- Owners of capital
- Holders of intellectual property
- Firms with scale and compute access
- Highly specialised technical talent

This dynamic is not new. The Industrial Revolution displaced artisans and agricultural workers. The rise of computing hollowed out clerical roles. But historically, these transitions unfolded over decades, giving institutions time to adjust.

AI compresses that timeline. Entire categories of cognitive work (writing, analysis, design, programming, logistics) are being reshaped simultaneously. The pace matters. Institutions such as education systems, labour markets, and social safety nets adapt slowly. Automation curves do not.

The result is not necessarily permanent unemployment. It is instability during transition. And instability at scale is a governance problem.

Imagine a factory that runs perfectly. No errors. No fatigue. No wages. Output is abundant and continuous.

From a production standpoint, this is a triumph.

But if workers are no longer earning wages, who purchases the goods? If economic participation narrows to capital ownership alone, what anchors dignity, bargaining power, or agency for the majority of people?

An economy is not only a system for producing goods. It is a system for distributing income and organising meaning. Work has historically been the primary mechanism through which people access both.

If AI severs income from labour without creating new distribution systems, efficiency becomes socially destabilising.

## Power through Efficiency

AI introduces a new scaling dynamic. A single frontier model can serve millions of users simultaneously. Improvements can be deployed globally overnight. The marginal cost of replication is close to zero.

This creates strong network effects and economies of scale. It favours concentration.

If a small number of firms or nations control the most productive AI systems, wealth centralises rapidly. And when economic power concentrates, political power often follows.

This is not just a question of fairness. It is a question of stability. Large-scale economic exclusion erodes institutional trust, increases polarisation, and fuels backlash. History repeatedly shows that technological progress without inclusive governance produces social fracture.

The Ideal World: The word “ideal” depends on what we value. 
If ideal means maximum productivity, AI can likely deliver it. A largely automated economy could generate extraordinary abundance. Goods and services could become cheaper than ever. Many forms of scarcity could diminish.
But if ideal means human flourishing, the picture becomes more complex.

An ideal AI-enabled economy might include:

- Shorter workweeks rather than mass unemployment
- Public dividends from AI-driven productivity
- Strong retraining systems
- Expanded access to education
- More time devoted to creative, relational, and civic roles

In such a system, AI amplifies human agency rather than replacing it. Economic participation may look different, but it does not disappear.

Contrast this with a poorly managed transition:

- Rapid job displacement
- Stagnant wages outside tech sectors
- Weak redistribution
- Concentrated ownership of AI infrastructure
- Political instability and backlash

The technology is the same in both scenarios. The difference lies in governance.

A Tough AI Governance Problem: Unlike regulating a single AI model, this tension touches every structural layer of society:

- Tax policy
- Labor law
- Education reform
- Corporate governance
- Social insurance
- International trade

It requires coordination across domains that rarely move in sync. It demands political consensus in environments that are often polarised. And it unfolds under conditions of technological acceleration.

Most importantly, it forces an uncomfortable philosophical choice:

Do we define prosperity primarily by output, or by participation?

Efficiency is easy to measure. Inclusion is harder to quantify but arguably more central to social cohesion.

Efficiency vs Inclusion: Tradeoff or Tension. It does not have to be.

The tension becomes a tradeoff only if productivity gains are allowed to concentrate without redistribution. If institutions are redesigned so that automation dividends flow broadly—through taxation, public ownership stakes, profit-sharing mechanisms, or social investment—efficiency and inclusion can reinforce each other.

In that case, AI becomes a force multiplier for human well-being rather than a substitute for human economic relevance.

## Progress and Expectations

We should not slow innovation out of fear. But we cannot assume that markets alone will align efficiency with inclusion. Governance must deliberately connect automation gains to broad-based economic empowerment.

If every major leap in machine capability is paired with mechanisms that expand human agency—through redistribution, reskilling, and shared ownership—then efficiency strengthens society instead of fragmenting it.

The challenge is not whether AI can build an efficient world.

It is whether we can build institutions that ensure people still have a meaningful place within it.
